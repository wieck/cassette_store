# FX-502P Music

To play music with the FA-1 interface, programs have to be entered
into the FX-502P and certain numbers be loaded into memory registers.
The music is basically a sequence of recalling a frequency from a
register for a certain duration.

To load these first load the program data (FPxxx) in PCL mode, then
load the memory register data (F_xxx) in RUN mode. Switch the FA-1
to MUSIC and enjoy.
